# Weather Forecast Chatbot

This is a simple weather forecast chatbot that provides current weather information for a given city using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Usage

1. Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your OpenWeatherMap API key in the `API_KEY` variable within the `get_weather` function.

2. To run the chatbot, execute the script in your terminal or code editor. It will continuously prompt you for input until you type 'exit' to quit.

3. You can ask the chatbot about the weather in a specific location by using phrases like:
   - "What's the weather like in [city]?"

4. The chatbot will provide the current temperature in Celsius and a brief description of the weather conditions for the specified city.

## Dependencies

  pip install requests
  ```
